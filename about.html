        <h2>Professional Background:</h2>

        <p>I am currently working as a Relationship Manager at <a href="https://www.g2.com/" target="_blank">G2
                Crowd</a>. Before G2, I worked at LinkedIn and Glassdoor. You can see my work history on <a
                href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cahnalex/" target="_blank">LinkedIn.</a> Outside of work I enjoy being
            active, spending time with my friends and girlfriend and working on side proejct which you can see on my
            Portfolio. I'm looking to combine my previous experience with my experience in Developing to bring value to
            any organization.</p>

        <h2>Expertise:</h2>

        <h4>FRONT END DEVELOPMENT</h4>
        <p>Front End Development is creating the visual front-end elements of a software, application or website. I
            create features that are directly viewable and accessible by the end user.</p>

        <h4>BACK END DEVELOPMENT</h4>
        <p>My knowledge of JavaScript, JQuery, Node.JS, and Express helps me create back-end logic of a website or
            software. I create components and features that help websites function and that are not directly seen by the
            user.</p>

        <h4>EXPERIENCE</h4>
        <p>I've worked at two rapid growth start-ups, Glassdoor and G2. Adding my experience at Linked shows that I can bring value to any size company.</p>
